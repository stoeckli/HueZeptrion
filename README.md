# HueZeptrion
Control Philips Hue lights with Feller Zeptrion keys and ESP8266

Demo Video on https://youtu.be/jSjQW7vah4E

Please note: This project was to demonstrate feasibility with the ESP8266 module only. If you are not into soldering, then please check out the the Feller/Schneider ZeptrionAir modules instead. With these you can also access any web service like Philips Hue or Sonos. Request the API document on their website for more info.
